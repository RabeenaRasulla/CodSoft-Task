# Titanic-Survival-prediction

Objective: Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using features such as age, gender, class, and more.

Dataset:

Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset).

Files used: train.csv (for training) and test.csv (for testing predictions).

Approach:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze and visualize the dataset to uncover patterns and relationships.

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical data.

Model Development: Train and evaluate machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).

Prediction: Use the trained model to predict survival on test data.

Technologies Used:

Python Libraries: "pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn".

Tools: "colaboratory Notebook" for development and visualization.

Key Steps:

Load and clean the dataset.

Perform feature engineering and selection.

Train multiple models and tune hyperparameters.

Evaluate models and choose the best-performing one.

Results:

Final model accuracy, along with precision, recall, and F1-score, is highlighted.
